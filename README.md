A bunch of fun encryption ciphers, hacked, in Python.

I'll be using Python 2.7 since it comes default on Mac

# Reverse Cipher
## A super easy to understand algorithm. It basically reverses a given input string. To decipher/hack it, simply enter the encrypted string again.
###Files:
* reverse.py

# Caesar Shift Cipher
## Another easy to understand algorithm. Every character is shifted by N. For example, if the key was 3, then A->D, B->E, and so on. Z->C, since it just wraps around the alphabets.
###Files:
* caesar.py
* caesarAdvanced.py
* caesarTest.py
